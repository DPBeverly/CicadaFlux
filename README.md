### Abstract:

The emergence of billions of periodical cicadas affects plant and animal communities profoundly, yet little is known about cicada impacts on soil carbon fluxes. We investigated the effects of Brood X cicadas (Magicicada septendecim, M. cassinii, and M. septendeculain) on soil CO2 fluxes (RS) in two Indiana forests. We hypothesized RS would be sensitive to emergence hole density, with the greatest effects occurring in soils with the lowest ambient fluxes. In support of our hypothesis, RS increased with increasing hole density, and greater effects were observed near AM-associating trees (which expressed lower ambient fluxes) than near EcM-associating trees. Additionally, RS from emergence holes increased temperature sensitivity (Q10) of RS by 13%, elevating the Q10 of ecosystem respiration. Brood X cicadas increased annual RS by ~2.5%, translating to an additional 717 Gg of CO2 across forested areas. As such, periodical cicadas can have substantial effects on soil processes and biogeochemistry.

### Research Questions: 

Our key questions on how cicada emergence influences soil respiration and carbon fluxes are:

1. To what extent does cicada emergence hole density influence R[S]?
2. How do soils beneath different tree types (i.e., AM vs EcM mycorrhizal fungi) modulate these effects?
3. To what extent do emergence holes influence ecosystem respiration (RECO)?

## Data Access and Analysis Workflow

To reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript, follow these steps:

1. **Repository Download**
   - Clone the repository or fork your own copy from GitHub:
     https://github.com/DPBeverly/CicadaFlux

2. **Data Access**
   - The primary data for this study is hosted on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/10125404
     - DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.8431547`
   - *Note*: The R Markdown file automatically retrieves the dataset using the DOI, so manual download from Zenodo is not required.

3. **AmeriFlux Data Download**
   - Obtain the AmeriFlux micrometeorological data associated with the US-MMS site from the AmeriFlux website: https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-MMS
   - Download the US-MMS Base version (CC-BY-4.0) which contains hourly flux and meteorological variables.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Once downloaded, unzip the folder in the working directory where the R Markdown files are located.
   - *Note*: The downloaded dataset may contain more recent data than was used in the manuscript, as the data on AmeriFlux is updated quarterly.

5. **Global Respiration Estimates**
   - Access the global soil respiration rasters derived from SRDB V3: https://daac.ornl.gov/CMS/guides/CMS_Global_Soil_Respiration.html
   - Download the data and move the `.img` files to the common working directory for use in the analysis. Utilize the mean, 25th percentile (lower quantile), and 75th percentile (upper quantile) estimates for the analysis.
